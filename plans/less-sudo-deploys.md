# Reducing Sudo Password Prompts in Deployment

## Problem
The deployment script required multiple interactive sudo password prompts during each deployment, breaking automation and requiring manual intervention for service restarts.

## Solution
Implemented zero-interaction deployments using two complementary approaches:

**User-Scope Systemd Services**
- Migrated from `sudo systemctl` to `systemctl --user` for service management
- Eliminates privilege escalation during deployments
- Services run in user scope instead of system-wide

**SSH Connection Multiplexing**
- Single SSH master connection reused for all deployment operations
- Reduces authentication overhead and connection latency
- Automatic cleanup handling prevents connection leaks

## Benefits
- **Zero-interaction deployments** - No password prompts or manual intervention
- **Improved security** - Services run without root privileges
- **CI/CD ready** - Fully automated deployment process
- **Better performance** - SSH multiplexing reduces connection overhead

## Technical Foundation
The solution leverages existing systemd user services and SSH ControlMaster capabilities, requiring no additional dependencies while maintaining operational simplicity.
