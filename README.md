# DisBot

A Discord Bot, that I'm not sure what it'll do yet - but I wanted to have something that:

- Powered by Go
- Deployed via Docker
- To a locally running Raspberry Pi

The rest I don't really care about at the moment :shrug-dog:

## This Project Uses

- [Wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for compile time DI
- [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) for the Discord API
